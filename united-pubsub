## Use cases 

 - SWIM  System wide info management 
 - Realtime message feed 
   - Events on raodports, traffic, airport operations
 - Publishers - Operations can post to the FAA

## Apache Kafka Vs Pulsar 

 - Distributed IO- claims that pulsar has faster io 
 - Allows for you to mix and match reading/writting with pub sub 
 - Kafak doesn't allow for you to scale down 
 - Pulsar scales better? (Need more info) 
 - Pulsar built from the transaction model, kafka not so good
